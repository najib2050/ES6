   <h1>INTRODUCTION TO SYNCHRONOUSE PROGRAMMING</h1>
   <P>
      Synchronous programminmg means that computers perfome tasks sequently follwing the structure in the excact order they were provided.

   </P>
   <p>
      consider the process of preparing a coffe with task such as boiling water, adding a coffe sachet, and adding sugar as per test.
      boiling water =>adding coffee=>adding sugar.
   </p>
   <p>
      just like tackling the kitchen task one by one waiting to complete each before starting the nect synchronouse programming ensures that a computer finishes one job before proceeding to the next.
   </p>
   <P>
      this method simplifies the understanding and anticipation of the compuetr actions at nay momment.
   </P>
   <div>
      // example of assynchronouse code in js 
      //defimne the function
      function task1(){
         console.log("task 1")
      }
      function task2(){
         console.log("task 2")
      }
      function task3(){
         console.log("task 3")
      }
      task1()
      task2()
      task3() 
      // autput: task 1,task 2, task 3;
   
   </div>
   <p>
      synchronouse programming may encouter issues, especially with operations that are time-consuming.
   </p>
   <p>
      imagine a scenario where a synchronouse application needs to wait for a reply from an external serever, during this wait time, the application cant perfore any other actions - its essentially on hold until it receives the server response.
   </p>
   <p>
      the situation known as blocking can make the application seem unresponsive or stuck /frozen to the user.
   </p>

<script type="text/javascript">
  
  function someLongRunningFun(){
   let start=Date.now();
   console.log("start:"+start)
   while(Date.now()-start <5000){
      
      //loop withou doing anything
   }
   return "hello"
  }
  console.log("starting ....")
  let result=someLongRunningFun();
  console.log(result);
  console.log("...finishing")
// in this a fore mentioned code snippet: 
//the process kicks off with a starting ... message output to the console.
//next it invoke someLongRunningFun() , mimicking a prolonged operation lasting 5 seconds during which the  program's subsequent excution is halted.
//after fininshing the function returns Hello , which then gets printed to the console.
//the sequence concludes with a finishing message in the console.

//dusring excution of someLongRunningFunc(), which lasts 5 seconds the program unable to proceed to the next line rendering it unrespponsive.
//the delay can significantly extend the program's overall runtime and negatively affect user exprience by making the application appear frozen.
//by adopting asynchronous programming applications can continue to run other tasks without posing thus remaining responsive while waiting for long process to finish.
