      -to address the challenges posed by callback hell, modern js 
      introduces PROMISES and ASYNC/AWAIT which offer cleaner and more manageable ways to handle asynchronouse operations.
      -however, understanding callbacks is fundermental as they from the basis of these more advance concepts.
      -callbacks are foundational concept in js enabling asynchronouse programming by allowing functions to excute
      after certain operations complere. thereby improving the effeciency and responsiveness of application.



      EXCUTE                   => PROMISE      => PROMISE CONSUMERS (HANDLERS)
      function(){....}         OBJECT{.....}      ,then(), .catch(), .finally()
      NB/ a promise object acts as a bridge betweeen an excutor function and the handler function.

      const morningRoutine=async (startTime)=>{
         
      }
