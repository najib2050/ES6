   <h1>what is call back</h1>
   <p>
      imagin your in a coffe shop,ordering your favorite drinks instead of waitnig 
      at the conter, you sit and prowse your phone. when you order's ready, the barista calls your name (acting as the callback)
      for you to collect your drink and move on. this way you are idly waiting waiting but are free to engage in other activities.

   </p>
   <p>
      in programming especially in js a callback works on a similar principle its a way to say. Hey go a head and do this task and when you done , let me know
      by calling the functin(callback) while waiting  for the task to complete your program isnt just sitting  idler it can continue excuting other task.

   </p>
   <p>
      a callback is a func that is passes to another fun as an argument
   </p>
   <p>
      these functions are predominantly utilized in js for crafting asychroous code 
   </p>
   <p>
      although  js typically excutes code in a sequential top-down manner certain sceario rewuire the code to excute in a specific sequency
   </p>
   <p>
      callback functions facilitates the requirement embodying the essence of asynchronuse programming
   </p>
   <p>
      functions that accept other function as arguments are termed higher-order fun
   </p>
   <div>
      <p>
         in the simplest terms a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is excuted
         after some operation has been completed.
         here's a very basic exmaple.
         function greet(name,callback){
            console.log("hi", name)
            callback()
      
         }
         greet("najiib",function(){
            console.log("callback function is called")
         })
      -in the example the greet function takes a name and a callback fun as arguments. it first logs a greeting message using the name and then it calls the callback func which logs another message.
      
      </p>
   </div>
</body>
<script type="text/javascript">
   sum(3,2,function(result){
      console.log("result:"+result)
   })

   function sum(a,b,callback){
      let sum=0
      sum=a+b;
       callback(sum)
   }
   function greet(name,callback){
      console.log("hi", name)
      callback()

   }
   greet("najiib",function(){
      console.log("callback function is called")
   })

</script>
