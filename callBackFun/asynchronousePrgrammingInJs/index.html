   <h1>asynchronous programming in javascript</h1>
   <p>
      asynchronousprogramming => is a paradigm that allows code excution to proceed without having to wait for potentially long running operation to complet.

   </p>
   <p>
      this is particularly used in tasks such as fetching data from a server reading files or queryung a database which can take significant time to complete.
   </p>
   <p>
      it helps in creating responsive,fast,and efficient applications by allowing these time-consuming operations to run in the background thereby not blocking the main thread of excution
   </p>
   <p>
      js implements asynchronous programming through several mechanisms

      1:callbacks
      2:promises
      3:asyn/await.
