      -the construictor for a promise accepts a single argument which is a callback fun. this callback func is provided with two parameters : resolve and reject;
     -the resolve function call denotes the successful completion of calls while the reject call denotes errors.

     const promise=new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
      //do a thing, possibly async, then.
      if(//everything turned out fine){
         resolve("stuff worked")
      }else{
