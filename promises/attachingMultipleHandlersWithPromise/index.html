   <h1>Attaching multiple handlers with promise</h1>
   <p>
      -a powerful feature of promise is their ability to have multiple handlers, enabling more complex and flexible asynchronouse flow control.
      -A single promise can have multiple .the() or cach() handlers attached to it.
      -we can attach multiple .the( )handlers to a promise each handler is excuted in the order they were added the value return from a .the() handler
      is passed to the enxt .then() handler in the chain.
      -by using multiple .cach() handlers you can provide layered error handling, where each handlers can deal with specific types of errors or perfome cleanupp actions.
              
                   new Promise()
                   /         /
                  /          /
               .then()     .then()  .then()
