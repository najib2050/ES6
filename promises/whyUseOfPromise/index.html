   </p>
   <h2>WHAY USE PROMISE IN JS</h2>
   <p>
      -promise can mitigate the CALLBACK HELL; the situation where code marches to the right faster than it marches forword.
   </p>
   <p>
      -it allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronouse action's eventual success value or failure reasons.
   </p>
   <p>
      promises make code easier to read and understand, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronouse tasks.
   </p>
   <p>
      provide a centralized handler for error management simplifying error handling.
