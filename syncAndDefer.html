   <!-- 
      async -> it decide how passing in engine occur
      WITHOUT AYNC
      html parsing bigins
      this pasing will stop the moment it encounters a js, start downloading it
      excution is started.
      we will resume HTML parsing

      WITH ASYNC
      html parsing starts
      but the moment it ecnounters a js it will not stop html parsing
      html will be parsed and js will be downloaded simultaniously
      once js is downloaded the HTML parsing stops and js axcution begins
      now when js excution stops
      HTML parsing continued
    -->
    <!-- 
      DEFER
      the deference btw defer and async is the way it is regulated

      in Defer :-
      html parsing begins
      js is encounted
      js will start downmloading and html be parsed simultaniously
      html parsing will continue at some point in time
      once html parsing is completed then only we will start js excution

      what is js liberary i.e jQuery

      what is the difference between a libery and frame work
      liberary=> is prewritten code 

      can web framwork and liberary work together
